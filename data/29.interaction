You see the <fire> begins to spread.
The three of you grab your brooms and begin to fly away; however, as the flames continue to rise rampantly you see the three who attacked you trapped. You decide to rescue them; however, Crabbe is engulfed in his Dark Magic curse and you are only able to rescue Goyle, and Malfloy. You dart to the exit and barely make your escape. In the last second before the door closes, you throw the Diadem back into the cursed Black Magic fire, and it is destroyed. With the horcrux destroyed, Voldemort can see his life slipping and you have a vision of him retreating to the Boat House.
