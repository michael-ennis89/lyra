You find yourself outside the British Ministry of Magic Headquarters; the entrance to which is in a public bathroom that leads to the underground fortress. You stand in line with dozens of other witches and wizards who one by one step inside the stall, close the door and magically disappear. It’s your’s and Ron’s turn; you step inside the stall and close the door.
You find yourself back at the Ministry of Magic Headquarters.
As the three of you jump in the fireplace to Disapparate, a Death Eater grabs a hold of Ron’s arm.
You run towards the <fireplace> to exit the headquarters.
