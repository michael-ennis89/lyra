You find yourself in the Forest that Hermione’s family visited often in her childhood.  Although the Death Eater grabbed Ron’s arm, the Death Eater wasn’t able to travel with you guys; however, Ron’s arm is severely hurt. As Hermione attends to Ron’s arm, the realization that you won't be able to travel for some time becomes apparent. As dawn approaches, Hermione tells you to set up a tent before it gets to dark. Looking back at her with a confused face, she points at her bag.
You find yourself back at the forest.
You put the tent away, and begin to lift the protective barriers around the area. As, the three of you come together, memories of your late parents begin to flood your mind as you begin to travel to the place where they were taken from you.
Hermione inspects ron and feels it safe for him to travel again. She suggests going to Godric’s <Hollow> to search for clues.
