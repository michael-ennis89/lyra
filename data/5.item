You see the plainly adorned <Diadem> sitting atop a stack of books.
You pick up the Diadem and place it in your bag. Suddenly, Malfloy, Crabbe, and Goyle appear, and confront you as Voldemort's pawns. Crabbe casts Fiendfyre at you; however, his wand malfunctions and he begins to spread the Cursed fire throughout the entire Room of Requirement.
You see the <Diadem> horcrux on the floor.
