You find yourself in the Courtyard. It seems a bit quiet here.
You enter the courtyard in Hagrid’s arms alongside Voldemort, Nagini and his followers. The students and Faculty come outside to see them as you hear Voldemort say, “Harry Potter is dead!”. As everyone stand back in disbelief, he continues and tells everyone to “Come forward and join us, or die”.  In the silence afterwards, many of the students from the Slytherin house join their parents; however, Neville Longbottom begins to speak out against Voldemort.

You find yourself standing on the bridge outside of Hogwarts with Ron and Hermione holding the Elder wand in your hand. Hermione asks, “Why didn’t it work for him, the Elder Wand”. You respond to him and tell her “It answered to somebody else. When he killed Snape, he thought the wand would become his, but the thing is, the wand never belong to Snape. It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore that night in the astrology tower. From that moment on, the wand answered to him. Until... the other night when I disarmed Draco at Malfloy manor, which means, the wand responded to me.” Ron asks, “Well what will you do with it?” You turn to the edge of the bridge, break it in half, and throw it over.
