You take out your wand to cast a spell at <nagini>.
As you begin to cast a spell nagini lunges at you and disarms you in the process. Hermione appears and casts a spell injuring nagini; however, in the process you fall through the floor and your wand is broken. You gather with Ron and Hermione outside and notice that the Death Eaters and the Dark Lord have been summoned to Godric's Hollow.
