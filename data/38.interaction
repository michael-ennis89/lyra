You look at the <headmaster> with disgust and anguish in your eyes.
You step out from the other students and begin to speak. “It seems, despite your exhaustive defensive strategies, you still have a bit of a security problem, Headmaster.”  A large group of Dumbeldore’s Army enter through the back door as you continue,  “How dare you stand where Dumbledore stood! Tell them how it happened that night. How you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you, and killed him.” Shocked and in disbelief the headmaster takes out his wand and points it at you.
