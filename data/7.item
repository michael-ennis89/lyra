Suddenly, the snitch begins to levitate in front of you. It opens up and a small <Stone> appears from it core.
You grab the stone realising that it is one of the Deathly Hallows, The Resurrection Stone. You continue through the forest until you find Voldemort standing with his followers.
You see The Resurrection <Stone> levitating in the air.
