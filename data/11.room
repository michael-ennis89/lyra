You find yourself at the Room of Requirement. It seems a bit quiet here.
You walk into the Room of Requirement where there a group of students gathered, most are your friends. As they erupt into cheers with excitement, Neville says to Lee Jordan, the host of Potterwatch, a popular radio show in opposition to Voldemort, to get the word out.  In the background you hear. "We have a new weather report. Lightning has struck, I repeat, Lightning has struck."

You, Ron, Hermione and the rest of the students leave the Room of Requirement. The students head towards the Great Hall.
