You look around and see an <elevator>.
You get inside the elevator with Ron and Hermione and it takes you downstairs. You immediately feel cold inside like hope has left you. As you walk down the dark hallway you enter a room that looks like a courtroom. She's here, as you look up you see Dolores Umbridge questioning a lady. Around her neck is the necklace you've been looking for... You can feel the polyjuice potion starting to fade away and realize there isn't any other way of getting the necklace without a fight.
