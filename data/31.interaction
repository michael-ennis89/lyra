You meet <Helena> Ravenclaw in Ravenclaw Tower.
\"You are hardly the first student to covet the diadem. Generations of students have badgered me.\" she begins. You interrupt and say \"This isn't about better marks! It's about Voldemort, defeating Voldemort, are you interested in that?\" After discussing your intentions, she tells you that her Diadem was cursed with Black Magic and is in the Room of Requirement.
