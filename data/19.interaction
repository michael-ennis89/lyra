Suddenly your friend <dobby> the house elf appears.
You ask him if there is anything he can do to help, and he simply opens the locks with a snap of his fingers. Elves don't need wands to do magic he says as he walks up the stairs where the Death Eaters are. You break into the room and where Hermione, Bellatrix and the other death eaters are, and with another snap of his fingers he takes Bellatrix's wand and you grab it from the sky. Your rival Draco Malfoy takes his wand out and points it as at you as if you were both going to duel.
