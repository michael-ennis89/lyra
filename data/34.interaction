You hear <Voldemort> start the incantation for the death spell, “AVADA KEVARA!”. You begin to cast a spell back.
“Expelliarmus” you cast back as you see your spell meet his green jet. Suddenly you see the Elder Wand flying high … spinning through the air towards the master it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it at last. Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and unknowing. Voldemort was dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and you stood with two wands in hand, staring down his at him.
