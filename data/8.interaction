You see a <toilet> in the stall.
You inspect the toilet; however, it doesn't seem special. Suddenly Ron peaks over the stall and says, "You stand in it... and flush". Perplexed, you do as he says and in a flash see yourself inside the headquarters. You find Ron and Hermione and begin walking down the hallway.
