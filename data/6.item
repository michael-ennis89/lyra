Hermione takes out a flash and hands it to you to collect his <Memories>.
You grab the flask and gather his memories in them. You put the flask in your bag. He tells you to take them to the pensive to reveal them, and with his dying breath he says, \"You have your mother's eyes.\"
You see a flask with Snapes <Memories> on the floor.
