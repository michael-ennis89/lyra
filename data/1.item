You look down at the light and see the <Sword> of Gryffindor resting at the bottom of the lake.
As you descend down into the icy water, the necklace horcrux begins to pull away from the sword. You continue to descend; however, as you grab the sword you feel as though the necklace takes over your body and you are unable to make it to the surface. When hope feels lost, a hand reaches down and grabs yours pulling you to safety. You get dressed and make your way back towards the tent.
