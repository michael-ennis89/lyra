Hermione suggests that you should <hide> and listen to them.
You listen as Voldemort asks why the Elder Wand does not respond to him.  Snape tries to assure him that the wand answers to him and him only. However, Voldemort begins to tell him that the wand owes its loyalty to the master who kills his last master, Snape. Voldemort casts a curse at Snape and Nagini attacks him then leaves.
