You hear a rattle in the <cupboard>.
A dishevelled house elf, named Kreacher falls out in fear. As you begin talking to him, you ask him about the locket to see if he knows about the whereabouts of the real locket. "Stolen", he replies. You ask him who stole it and he replies again with one word, "Mundungus". Thoughts of anger being to grow towards Mundungus as you remember that Mad Eye was killed because of this possible traitor. As you tell Kreacher to "Go get Him!", he disapparates instantly and the house is quiet again.
