You see a bright <light> in the distance.
You walk towards the light and find yourself in a room that appears to look like King’s Cross. Dumbledore is there and you begin to speak with him. “You brave, brave boy he says”. He continue to explain how Voldemort's soul was no longer a part of him and that he could now be defeated. As he leaves you, you use the Resurrection Stone and you come back to life in a dazed state. You lay still and keep quiet.
