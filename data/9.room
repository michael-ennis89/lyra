You find yourself back at Gringotts Bank.
You find yourself in Diagon Alley about to go inside the bank. Hermione uses a polyjuice potion and looks as though she is Bellatrix Lestrange, while you and Griphook are underneath you cloak of invisibility trailing closely behind them. As Hermione enters the bank she goes up to the banker and says, "I wish, to see, my vault" The banker asks for her identification ase she replies. "I hardly think that will be necessary" in a snarky rebellious voice. The guards begin to look suspicious of her and Griphook whispers, "They know.. Do something or we're done."
You look to jump on the <dragon>.
You jump on the dragon and he takes off navigating through the vast underground caves to burst through the roof up the bank and make its escape. It gains altitude quickly and continues to fly out of Diagon Alley and over the city of London. As it is already too high to get off, you stay on the dragon as he travels east towards Hogwarts.
