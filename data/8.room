You find yourself back at the Beach House.
You find yourself slightly disoriented with sand underneath you. As you come too, you see some commotion around Dobby. As you get closer you see that he was hit in the chest by the piece of glass that Bellatrix threw at the group. As you all comfort him in his final minutes you decide to give him a proper burial.
You ask him to take you to Gringot <bank> to steal the horcrux.
He agrees; however, he demands that you give him the Sword of Gryffindor as payment for his services. You reluctantly agree and begin your travel to the bank on Diagon Alley.
