Your journey starts at, 4 Privet Drive. You hear the doorbell ring, and you welcome a large group of your friends inside. It’s the night before your birthday and the time has come for you to leave the protection of your childhood home.  There is an eerie feeling in the room as though there's a traitor in their midst.
You find yourself back at your childhood house. 
You climb into Hagrid’s motorcycle and after a moment of silence  he says, “It's just like when I brought you here all those years ago.” On the count of three, all his friends he’d come so close to over the past years took off in unison and parted ways as they travelled to the Weasley’s House.  This silence was short as groups of Deatheaters descended upon them and began to attack.
Hagrid starts his <motorcycle>. Looks like it's time to go.
