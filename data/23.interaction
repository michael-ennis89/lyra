You look to cast a spell at the <banker>.
You cast the unforgivable curse at the banker, taking him under your control. "You're right, it isn't necessary" you make him say as he make him guide you down towards the vault. As you get towards the vault you are stopped by an alarm that alerts the bank of your intruding. Additionally you find a dragon guarding the vault.
