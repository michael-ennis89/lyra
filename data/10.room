You find yourself back at Hogsmeade.
As the dragon begins to descend you find yourself outside of Hogwarts with a lake beneath you. The three of you jump into the lake and swim to the shore. After drying off, you make your way towards Hogsmeade where you will attempt to gain access to the School from. As you enter Hogsmeade, loud sirens begin to go off and a large amount of guards and death eaters begin running from the bars yelling "Heâ€™s here, Harry Potter is here." You all hide.
A <tunnel> opens up.
Out from the tunnel pops a student as you say "Neville" in a surprised voice. "I knew you would come" he replies. "Lets Go" he says "The Room of Requirement is the only way in or out now. The grounds are crawling with Death Eaters and Dementors."
