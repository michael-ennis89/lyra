You find yourself back at the Weasley's Burrow.
You arrive with Hagrid at the Burrow and are the only ones there. As time passes, the other begin to arrive you find out that Mad Eye was killed on his way, George was severely injured, and Mandongus never showed up.  As the night settles, everyone goes to bed to prepare for a wedding tomorrow. An odd time for a wedding you think to yourself... As you wake up in the morning you go down to the living room. 
Arthur Weasley grabs you, Hermione and Ron and yells, "Run <away>!"
You all lock arms and Hermione casts disapparate.
