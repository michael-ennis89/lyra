The <horcrux> begins to open up and speak in parseltongue to you.
As you speak back to it, it opens up, and begins to warp the images of your’s and Ron’s mind.

It breaks in two as a black smoke in the form of a snake pours from it with a last dying hiss. You return to the tent and tell Hermione of the events.
