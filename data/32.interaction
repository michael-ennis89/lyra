"I'd like to say something", he says as Voldemort snarkily replies. "It doesn't matter that Harry's gone.  People die every day. Friends, family. Yeah, we still lost Harry tonight. He's still with us, in our hearts. So's Fred, Remus, Tonks ...  They didn't die in vain. But YOU will. Cause you're wrong! Harry’s heart did beat for us! For all of us! It's not over!\" Neville suddenly pulls the Sword of Gryffindor out of the sorting cap he's holding. You jump from Hagrid's arms and at Voldemort and the other Death Eaters astonishment that you were still alive you cast a Confringo spell at them and run away towards the army of faculty and students.
