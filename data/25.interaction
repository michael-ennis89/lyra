Suddenly a man quietly appears that looks a lot like Dumbledore and tells you to follow him. That's <Aberforth>, Dumbledore's brother Hermione says.
You follow him to his house and thank him for saving you. As you begin to talk to him about your mission that his brother sent you on, you can tell that he is frustrated with his brother but agrees to help you.
