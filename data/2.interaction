The Minster of Magic shows up with a <will>.
The Minister of Magic opens up the will and reads it to Harry, Hermione, and Ronald. \"To Ronald Bilius Weasle, I leave my Deluminator, in hope that he will remember me when he uses it.\" \"Interesting\" Ron says in a perplexed voice. \"To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive. And To Harry James Potter... I leave the snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill.\"
