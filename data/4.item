You see a <chalice> sitting on a ledge.
You grab the chalice and run outside the vault where the drag is blocking your exit alongside a group of guards  and Griphook. Without a way out you suddenly look over at Hermione as she says, “Follow Me!” and jumps on the dragon.
You see the horcurx <chalice> on the floor.
