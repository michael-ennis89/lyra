You see a <Chalice> sitting on a ledge.
You grab the Chalice and run outside the vault where the drag is blocking your exit alongside a group of guards  and Griphook. Without a way out you suddenly look over at Hermione as she says, "Follow Me!" and jumps on the Dragon.
You see the horcrux <Chalice> on the floor.
