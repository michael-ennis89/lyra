Up ahead you see an elderly woman watching you. Although the others are unsure of who she is, You know it’s <Bathilda> Bagshot.
As you get closer, she begins to walk away and enters her home. You follow her inside and begin to look around as you split up from Hermione.  You follow her upstairs you sense something isn’t right. As you begin looking at a picture book on the nightstand you begin talking to her; however, she isn’t responding and is standing quietly in the corner of the room. Suddenly, you notice she sheds her spell concealing her identity and a large snake named nagini lunges at you.
