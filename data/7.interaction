You hear struggling in the living room, and see <Mundungus> being held down by Kreacher and your friend Dobby.
You pull your wand out and begin questioning Mundungus about the whereabouts of the real locket, when suddenly he pauses and looks down at the floor seeing the newest edition of the Daily Prophet Newspaper. "Huh", he says "She stole it from me..." as he points down to a picture of a woman on the front page. As you inspect the photograph you realise who that woman is... Dolores Umbridge.  Although she was the Headmistress of Hogwarts last year, she was now the Head of the Muggle-Born Registration Commission at the Ministry of Magic Headquarters.
