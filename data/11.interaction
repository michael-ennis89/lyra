Inside her bag you see a <tent>. Knowing you've never set one up before, you think for a spell  to cast on it to set up.
The tent sets itself up and when it's done you bring Ron inside. Hermione begins casting enchantments around the tent to keep everyone safe for the time being. Several days come to past and as Ron heals you continue discussions on how to finish your mission of finding and destroying the Horcruxes.  The mission feels impossible and you begin to feel hopeless. As the other go to bed, it's your time to stand watch at night.
