12 Grimmauld Place, a home that brings back many memories of your late Godfather Sirius Black. As you enter the dimly lit residence, the dust in the air causes you to cough which echos down the hallway. The place that looks as though it has been vacant for decades is still adorned with decorations honoring the Black family. “Harry”, Hermione says as she looks inspects a doorway that has the initials R.A.B engraved on it. “The Locket!”. As you grab the fake locket from your bag you re-read the note to the Dark Lord signed by the same R.A.B. “Regulus Black” you say. “Regulus Arcturus Black, he knew of the horcruxes and was trying to stop Voldermort” As you talk with Ron and Hermione about whether he was able to destroy the real horcrux you begin to settle down for the night.
You find yourself back at the safehouse.
You, Ron and Hermione travel outside to the Ministry of Magic Headquarters downtown. Hiding in an alleyway outside of the secret entrance you seek out a witch and two wizards casting a stun spell. “Stupefy” ron says as the final wizard is lured to the alleyway. A pinch of hair from each of them complete the polyjuice potions as you all take a drink and put on their clothes to complete the disguise.
Hermione says, “ We must go to the <headquarters> and retrieve that locket.”
