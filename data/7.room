You find yourself back at Malfloy Manor.
You awaken inside the dungeon of the Malfloy Manor, Ron, Xenophilius Lovegood, and a Goblin named Griphook are also there. You can hear the screams of Hermione in the distance as Bellatrix Lestrange tortures her. As you look around you wonder if there is anyway out of the dungeon.
You group up and look to go to the <beach> house.
You all begin to disapparate; however, Bellatrix takes a piece of broken glass and throws it and the group. In an instant you are gone from the Manor.
